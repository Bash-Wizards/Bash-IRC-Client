# Bash IRC Client
--------------------------------------
  This is just a bash bot turned into an IRC Client that is in development!!!
  Original code - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9493e93c46f9a175aebb
--------------------------------------
## How to use!!!
  - Not very user friendly atm!!! Will work on this
1. Configure bot.properties
  - If no password leave it as it is.
  - Really only need to edit server, channel, and nick.
2. Wait for it to connect all the way!!!
3. Mesage examples below!
  - PRIVMSG #channel HI
  - JOIN #channel
  - PRVMSG nick Hi the is a private msg
--------------------------------------
## TO DO
1. Fix not connecting sometimes!!!
  - Possibly openssl cert!!! look into the openssl --help
2. Clean Up!!!
3. Create read input to variables for server, port, nick, and pass unpon startup!!!
  - Rework how u print the variables and join channel all to happen one after another??? maybe i think lol
4. Look into coloring!!! MAKE IT LOOK SICK!!!
5. Maybe add an up arrow feature to grab last msg!!!
