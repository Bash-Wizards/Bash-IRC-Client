# Bash IRC Client
--------------------------------------
  This is just a bash bot turned into an IRC Client that is in development!!!
  If you would like to use the only way for the input box is for someone to type -speakzen into the channel.
--------------------------------------
Current Dependency -- zenity
--------------------------------------
# IN DEVELOPMENT!!!
--------------------------------------
## TO DO
1. Fix not connecting sometimes.
## Possibly not authenticating correctly or maybe need to check ssl cert if valid.
2. Maybe find new pop up input box method.
## When the pop up is enabled it seems to not like to send PING response! 
## Would be cool if it was just terminal input like irssi
3. If keep zenity input box pop up then configure something like read keypress to pop up!
